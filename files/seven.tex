\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{seven}

In this thesis, we demonstrated that it is possible to extend LLVM type system to support Parabix technology. We have shown systematic support of the vector of $i2^k$ and support of critical Parabix operations in the target-independent IR library. We have also shown in one specific target: Intel X86, we can generate efficient native code. We added a new LLVM intrinsic that enables chained additions on long bit streams, which can be used for a broad category of applications.
